data on future without having any recurrence or link with sales or other concepts.

The module allows to determinate a fixed amount that will be invoiced to a
customer in a fixed data on future.

Tips:

* It's possible to filter the billing lines where the invoice date has reached
  the deadline.
* One single line can be invoiced using the small button on the right of the line.
* Several lines can be invoiced together using the selection check on tree plus
  action button "create invoice".
* Several lines will be included on the same invoice, just if they have got the
  same customer and the same invoice date. Otherwise they will be separated in
  different invoices.

Once the invoices has been generated it will be shown on tree and it will be
possible to navigate to it just clicking over it.
