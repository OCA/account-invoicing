Account Invoice Zero Autopay
============================

Invoices with a amount of 0 are automatically set as paid.

When an invoice has an amount of 0, Odoo still generates a
receivable/payable move line with a 0 balance.  The invoice stays as
open even if there is nothing to pay.  The user has 2 ways to set the
invoice as paid: create a payment of 0 and reconcile the line with the
payment or reconcile the receivable/payable move line with itself.
This module takes the latter approach and will directly set the invoice
as paid once it is opened.

One possible use case is that users create sales orders with price 0
to deliver free products (gifts, faulty products replenishment...),
and always stay undone due to this. Another one is when dealing with 
discount coupon codes that leads to a 0 amount sales order.

This module was named 'account_invoice_zero' before v8
