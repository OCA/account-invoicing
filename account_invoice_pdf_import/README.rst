==========================
Account Invoice PDF Import
==========================

This module has been started by lazy accounting users who hate enter they supplier invoices manually in Odoo. As ERP consultants, we have a number of supplier invoices to enter regularly in the system from the same suppliers : phone bill, Internet access, train tickets. Most of these invoices are available as PDF. We dream that we would be able to automatically extract from the PDF the required information to enter the invoice as supplier invoice in Odoo.

In the future, we hope we will have structured information embedded inside the metadata of PDF invoices. There is already a standard for this in Germany called `ZUGFeRD <http://www.pdflib.com/knowledge-base/pdfa/zugferd-invoices/>`_ ; we hope that other countries will adopt this standard or a similar one.
