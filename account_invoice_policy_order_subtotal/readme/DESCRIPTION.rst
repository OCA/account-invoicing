On sale order lines we want to have the possibility to add a line where the product of type
consumable (product for which stock is not managed) represents a financial amount not linked to any
delivered product or service.

For this type of lines, the invoicing policy is focused on the subtotal amount.
This means that the line can be invoiced as long as the amount already invoiced does not reach
the subtotal amount.
