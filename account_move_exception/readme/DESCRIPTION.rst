This module allows you attach several customizable exceptions to your
account move in a way that you can filter moves by exceptions type and fix them.

This is especially useful in an scenario for mass accounts move import, because it's likely some moves have
errors when you import them (like product not found in Odoo, wrong line
format etc.)
