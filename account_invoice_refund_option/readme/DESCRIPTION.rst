This module extends the functionality of accounting invoices to support setting
an invoice to be a refund and to allow you to create refunds directly, without
the need of refunding an existing normal invoice.

This is useful in several cases:

* You need to make a refund to your customer that doesn't come from any invoice. For example, a rappel refund.
* You have started to use Odoo, but your company is older that the switch to it, and the original invoice is not in new system.
