Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Settings > Technical > Tier Validations > Tier Definition*.
#. Create a new tier or edit an existing one.
#. Set the "Validated by" field to "Field in related record".
#. Set the "Reviewer field" to "Responsible for Approval".

A default tier validation called "Validation with Approver field" is set with this configuration.

Usage
=====

You can assign a default user for approval associated to a supplier. In the
partner form view, go to the *Sales and Purchase* tab, and into the *Purchase*
section, and fill the field *Approver of Vendor Bills*.

When you create a vendor bill the field *Responsible for Approval* will be
filled in with the partner's default. You can change it if needed.

Be aware that you won't be able to post a vendor bill unless you have indicated
a Responsible for Approval.

Used in connection with the module *Account Move Tier Validation* you can set
up approvals specific to a department.
