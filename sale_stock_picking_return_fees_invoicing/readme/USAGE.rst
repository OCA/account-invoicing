Once installed, A check box is added on the stock return wizard to specify if
fees must be charged. The same field is added on each line into the wizard.
You are therefore able to choice to charge for all the goods returned or select
which line should be charged.

By default no fees are charged in case of customer return. I you want to
charge fees you can:

* Specify on the customer contact form that fees must be charged by default
  in case of return of goods. This value is used as default value into the
  stock return wizard;
* Use the checkboxes into the stock return wizard.

For each returned product, if fees must be charged, once the return picking
is done, a new line is added into the origin sale order to charge fees. The
quantity charged is always 1 whatever the number of items of the same product
returned.
