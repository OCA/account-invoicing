================================================
Invoices created from picking grouped by product
================================================

This module allows you to group invoices generated from pickings by product
or by product category.

Usage
=====

This is possible by selecting the related option in the wizard used
for creating draft invoices.

Example
--------

Created the following pickings:

1. picking_1 - partner_1
    1. product_A - category_1
    2. product_B - category_2
2. picking_2 - partner_2
    1. product_C - category_2
    2. product_D - category_3
3. picking_3 - partner_1
    1. product_C - category_2
    2. product_D - category_3
    3. product_A - category_1

Selecting option 'Group by product category' I get the following invoices:

1. invoice_1 - partner_1
    1. product_A - category_1 --> picking_1
    2. product_A - category_1 --> picking_3
2. invoice_2 - partner_1
    1. product_B - category_2 --> picking_1
    2. product_C - category_2 --> picking_3
3. invoice_3 - partner_1
    1. product_D - category_3 --> picking_3
4. invoice_4 - partner_2
    1. product_C - category_2 --> picking_2
5. invoice_5 - partner_2
    1. product_D - category_3 --> picking_2

On the contrary if I select option 'Group by product' I get the following
invoices:

1. invoice_1 - partner_1
    1. product_A - category_1 --> picking_1
    2. product_A - category_1 --> picking_3
2. invoice_2 - partner_1
    1. product_B - category_2 --> picking_1
3. invoice_3 - partner_1
    1. product_C - category_2 --> picking_3
4. invoice_4 - partner_1
    1. product_D - category_3 --> picking_3
5. invoice_5 - partner_2
    1. product_C - category_2 --> picking_2
6. invoice_6 - partner_2
    1. product_D - category_3 --> picking_2
