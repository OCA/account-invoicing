This module adds the option to add reimbursables to supplier invoices.

Reimbursables are payments for services that your supplier has made on behalf
of your company as part of an agreement.
Your company receives two invoices: one from the supplier, that includes
the reimbursable, and your company should pay, and one from the third party
that has been paid by your supplier on your behalf.

For example, when you set up a company your lawyer might pay for various
government fees on your behalf, that the lawyer is then going to pass on to you
as a reimbursable in the invoice. You will still receive an invoice for the
government fees, but you have no obligation to pay them, because they have
already been paid by your lawyer.
