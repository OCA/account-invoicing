This module extends the payment terms computation allowing to base them on date ranges.

The typical use case:

- Date in 1째 quarter --> due date in specific day of May
- Date in 2째 quarter --> due date in specific day of August
- Date in 3째 quarter --> due date in specific day of November
- Date in 4째 quarter --> due date in specific day of February (next year)

See demo data for the example.
