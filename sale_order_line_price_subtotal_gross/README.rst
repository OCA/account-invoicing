====================================
Sale order line gross price subtotal
====================================

This module adds a new field 'price_subtotal_gross' to sale order line and
customizes the view to replace 'price_subtotal' with 'price_subtotal_gross'.
This is mostly to customize what is displayed in the client to customer
requirements. The behaviour of price_subtotal is not changed.
No changes to existing business logic.
