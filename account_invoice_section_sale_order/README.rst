When invoicing multiple sale orders at the same time, sale orders may be grouped
by customer into a single invoice. Unfortunately when this happens, it is hard
to know which invoice line belongs to which sale order.

This module helps by grouping invoicing lines into sections with the name of the
targeted sale order.
This is only done when an invoice targets multiple sale order.
