==============================
Account Payment Term Extension
==============================

This module extends the functionality of payment terms to :

* support rounding, months and weeks on payment term lines
* allow to set more than one day of payment in payment terms
* if a payment term date is a holiday, it is postponed to a selected date
* allow to apply a chronological order on lines
 * for example, with a payment term which contains 2 lines
  * on standard, the due date of all lines is calculated from the invoice date
  * with this feature, the due date of the second line is calculated from the due date of the first line

Configuration
=============

To configure the Payment Terms and see the new options on the Payment Term Lines, you need to:

#. Go to the menu Accounting > Configuration > Management > Payment Terms.

To use multiple payment days, define for each payment term line which payment days apply, separated by spaces, commas or dashes.
To use holidays, insert the holiday and the date payment terms will be postponed to.
