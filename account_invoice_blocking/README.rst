========================
Account Invoice Blocking
========================

This module allows the user to set a blocking (No Follow-up) flag directly on the invoice. This facilitates the blocking of the invoice's move lines.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Future possible improvement :
Blocking invoice can also mean "do not send overdue reminders", so the blocking flag could be displayed on both supplier and customer invoices.
