To use this module, you need to:

#. Configure a default validation user for each company in Settings/Accounting/Invoice Validation.
#. Add security group 'Invoice Validation' to users that need to be able to validate Invoices.
#. Add security group 'Invoice validation: can assign validation user' to users that need to be able to asign validation users.
#. You can choose to 'Use Partner's Approver As First Approval On Invoices'. In this case, if an approver is set on partner, there will be two steps of approbation otherwise, only one step will be needed and the approver will be the 'main approver' set on company.
