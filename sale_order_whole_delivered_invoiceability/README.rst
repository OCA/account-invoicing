This module prevents the invoiceability of the sale orders until all the
stockable products has been delivered.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

#. Create a new storable product
#. Set its invoicing policy as "Delivered Quantities".

Usage
=====

To use this module you need to:

#. Go to a customer that you do not want to invoice for incomplete deliveries and check the option ‘Whole Delivered Invoiceability’.
#. Create a sales order and do a partial delivery.

Although it is possible to create an invoice from the order itself, the ‘Create invoice’ button will remain white and the order will not appear in the list of orders to be invoiced, which can be consulted from the ‘To invoice’ menu.
