This module allows to use custom criteria for grouping sales orders to
be invoiced.

Default criteria for grouping (invoicing partner, company and used
currency) will be always applied, as if not respected, there will be
business inconsistencies, but you can add more fields to split the
invoicing according them.

**Table of contents**

Configuration
=============

For creating new grouping criteria:

1. Go to *Invoicing > Configuration > Management > Invoicing Grouping
   Criteria*.
2. Create or modify existing criteria, selecting fields belonging to
   "Sales Order" header model for grouping according them.
3. Invoicing address and currency will always be applied with the
   selected ones.

For setting a different grouping criteria for a specific customer:

1. Go to *Invoicing > Sales > Master Data > Customers*.
2. Open the desired customer.
3. Go to *Invoicing* page.
4. Set on "Sales Invoicing Grouping Criteria" the desired grouping
   criteria.

For setting a different default grouping criteria than the standard for
the whole company:

1. Go to *Invoicing > Configuration> Settings*.
2. Locate inside "Sales Order Invoicing" section, the field "Default
   Grouping Criteria".
3. Introduce there the grouping criteria to be applied by default. If
   empty, the general default of invoicing address + currency + company
   will be applied.

Usage
=====

1. Go to *Sales > Invoicing > Orders to Invoice*.
2. Select sales orders whose invoicing you want to do.
3. Click on *Action > Invoice Order*.
4. Click on "Create and View Invoices" button.
5. On that moment, the grouping criteria will be applied, and you will
   see different invoices if the criteria doesn't match for them.
