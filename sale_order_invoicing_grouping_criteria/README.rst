This module allows to use custom criteria for grouping sales orders to be
invoiced.

Default criteria for grouping (invoicing partner, company and used currency)
will be always applied, as if not respected, there will be business
inconsistencies, but you can add more fields to split the invoicing according
them.

Installation
============

This module only works in an updated 13.0 version after the 4th of March of 2020,
specifically after the commit https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/6f036e758000.

Configuration
=============

For creating new grouping criteria:

#. Go to *Invoicing > Configuration > Management > Invoicing Grouping Criteria*.
#. Create or modify existing criteria, selecting fields belonging to "Sales
   Order" header model for grouping according them.
#. Invoicing address and currency will always be applied with the selected
   ones.

For setting a different grouping criteria for a specific customer:

#. Go to *Invoicing > Sales > Master Data > Customers*.
#. Open the desired customer.
#. Go to *Invoicing* page.
#. Set on "Sales Invoicing Grouping Criteria" the desired grouping
   criteria.

For setting a different default grouping criteria than the standard for the
whole company:

#. Go to *Invoicing > Configuration> Settings*.
#. Locate inside "Sales Order Invoicing" section, the field "Default
   Grouping Criteria".
#. Introduce there the grouping criteria to be applied by default. If empty,
   the general default of invoicing address + currency + company will be
   applied.

Usage
=====

#. Go to *Sales > Invoicing > Orders to Invoice*.
#. Select sales orders whose invoicing you want to do.
#. Click on *Action > Invoice Order*.
#. Click on "Create and View Invoices" button.
#. On that moment, the grouping criteria will be applied, and you will see
   different invoices if the criteria doesn't match for them.
