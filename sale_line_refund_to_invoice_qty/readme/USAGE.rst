When creating a credit note from an invoice, you can mark the checkbox "Not
reinvoice refunded quantity" to prevent the refunded quantities to be deducted
from the quantity invoiced of the related sales order lines.

Furthermore, after creating the credit note, you can mark the field "Sale qty
not to reinvoice" to decide the criteria to be used for each specific invoice
line.

Enabling the "Reinvoice credit note by default" flag in the Invoice settings, will
enable the "This credit note will be reinvoiced" flag on Credit Notes by default.
