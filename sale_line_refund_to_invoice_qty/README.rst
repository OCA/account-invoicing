notes should be considered as quantities to be reinvoiced in the related sales,
thus deciding if they should be added or not to the quantity to invoice of the
related sales order line.

Usage
=====

When creating a credit note from an invoice, you can mark the checkbox "Not
reinvoice refunded quantity" to prevent the refunded quantities to be deducted
from the quantity invoiced of the related sales order lines.

Furthermore, after creating the credit note, you can mark the field "Sale qty
not to reinvoice" to decide the criteria to be used for each specific invoice
line.
