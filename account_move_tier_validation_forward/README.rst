This module extends tier validation with "Forward" button for Invoices and
Bills.

When a document is forwarded, a new Tier Validation is created on the fly for selected user as a minor
sequence tier (i.e., 1.1, 2.1), and the current tier's status will be completed as "Forwarded".

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.
