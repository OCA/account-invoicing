To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to your picking;
#. If the invoice status is 'To be invoiced', a button will ask you to create an invoice;
#. Into the Tree view, you can select many pickings and create a grouped invoice;
#. If at least an invoice is created for a picking, a new "Invoicing" tab appears.


If an invoice (not refund) is cancelled or deleted, invoice status of related picking is automatically
updated to "To be invoiced".
