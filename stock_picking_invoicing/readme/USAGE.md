To use this module, you need to:

1.  Go to your picking;
2.  If the invoice status is 'To be invoiced', a button will ask you to
    create an invoice;
3.  Into the Tree view, you can select many pickings and create a
    grouped invoice;
4.  If at least an invoice is created for a picking, a new "Invoicing"
    tab appears.

If an invoice (not refund) is cancelled or deleted, invoice status of
related picking is automatically updated to "To be invoiced".
