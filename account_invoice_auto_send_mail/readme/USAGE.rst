It will be necessary that at the level of each journal (related to type = sales) we define the fields:
- Email template: Email template to be used to send each of the invoices
- Author: If you want to establish it, it will replace the user_id of the invoice
- Invoice days: Defines the number of days that must pass between the invoice and the current date for them to be sent
