Often the total discount on an invoice line is the result of multiple cumulative discounts offered
to the customer for different reasons. Sometimes, it's desirable to display a detail of how the total
discount on an invoice line was computed.

This module allows to express discounts on invoice lines as mathematical expressions rather than a single number.
For example, if I wish to offer to a particular customer a 10% discount for the selected payment method and
an additional 20% discount for the selected payment term, on Odoo I should write a total discount of 28%;
Using this module, instead, I can simply write '10+20' in the discount column.
