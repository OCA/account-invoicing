Configuration
=============

1. Go to Invoicing > Configuration > Invoice Approval Flows;
2. create a flow;

The sequence determines the priority of the flow. When a invoice is submitted for review the
first encountered / matched flow (ordered by sequence) will be selected.
When no flow matched for the invoice the invoice is directly approved.

3. configure steps;

All users on a step has to approve it before it progresses to next step. 'Allowed Overrides By' users have special rights
and are able to override the approval flow (e.g. when somebody is sick).

Usage
=====

After you configured your approval flows (see section Configuration).

#. Create an invoice;
#. press 'Submit for Review';
#. if everything is configured right (see section Configuration) a tab 'Approval' should appear;
#. the tab shows the currently selected approval flow and other approval related information;
#. when all users (of the current step) approved the invoice it goes to the next step or state approved (if there's no steps left) automatically;
#. when an user refuses an invoice it goes to the state refused from there you'll be able to reset it to draft.
