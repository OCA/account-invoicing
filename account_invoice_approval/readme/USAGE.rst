After you configured your approval flows (see section Configuration).

#. Create an invoice;
#. press 'Submit for Review';
#. if everything is configured right (see section Configuration) a tab 'Approval' should appear;
#. the tab shows the currently selected approval flow and other approval related information;
#. when all users (of the current step) approved the invoice it goes to the next step or state approved (if there's no steps left) automatically;
#. when an user refuses an invoice it goes to the state refused from there you'll be able to reset it to draft.
