# TODO : the PDF saved as attachment is NOT the good one...
# but the PDF opened from the attachment is OK !
# because we don't inherit the right method.
# get_pdf() calls _run_wkhtmltopdf() which generate
# AND SAVE AS ATTACHMENT the report. So we need a hook inside _run_wkhtmltopdf
# but there is no hook for the moment
# The problem is the same in the module
