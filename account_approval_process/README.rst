Usage
=====

At the company (Settings -> Users & Companies -> Companies) enter the levels in
the "Account approval process" tab.
If no mail template has been selected, only a message appears in the chatter.

As soon as one level takes effect (or more), the "Request Approval" button is
shown and the "Validate" button is hidden. Users who are authorized at the
current level are shown the "Approve Invoice" button.
When all levels have been completed or there is no level, the "Validate" button
appears.
