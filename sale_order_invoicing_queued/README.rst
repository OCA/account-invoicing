This module allows to enqueue in several jobs the sales orders invoicing
process to be executed in paralell on background, which is normally done
serially and on foreground.

Jobs are split following the same criteria as standard Odoo: grouping by
order invoicing address and order currency.

Installation
============

This module depends on *queue_job* module that is hosted on
https://github.com/OCA/queue.

It only works in an updated 13.0 version after the 4th of March of 2020,
specifically after the commit https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/6f036e758000.

Configuration
=============

Jobs are enqueued in the channel ``root.sale_order_invoicing_queued``,
so you must adjust your Odoo configuration according this.

If you want to see queued jobs, you need "Job Queue / Job Queue Manager"
permission in your user.

Usage
=====

#. Go to *Sales > Invoicing > Orders to Invoice*.
#. Select sales orders whose invoicing you want to enqueue.
#. Click on *Action > Invoice Order*.
#. Click on "Enqueue Invoicing" button.
#. On that moment, jobs will be enqueued on foreground, but the control will
   be returned to you after that.
#. Having the "Job Queue Manager" permissions, you can go to the sales order,
   and see the tab "Invoicing Jobs". There a list with all the jobs related
   to that sales order can be found.
