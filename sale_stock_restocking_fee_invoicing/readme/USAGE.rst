Once installed, A check box is added on the stock return wizard to specify if
restocking fee must be charged. The same field is added on each line into
the wizard. You are therefore able to choice to charge for all the goods
returned or select which line should be charged.

By default no restocking fee are charged in case of customer return. If you
want to charge restocking fee you can:

* Specify on the customer contact form that restocking fee must be charged by
  default in case of return of goods. This value is used as default value into
  the stock return wizard;
* Use the checkboxes into the stock return wizard.

For each returned product, if restocking fee must be charged, once the return
picking is done, a new line is added into the origin sale order to charge fees.
The quantity charged is always 1 whatever the number of items of the same
product returned.
