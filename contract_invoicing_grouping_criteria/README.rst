This module allows to group invoicing of several contracts and to use custom 
criteria for grouping contracts to be invoiced.

This module mimics the sale.order grouping behavior of the sale module and adds
the sale_order_invoicing_grouping_criteria's custom criteria mechanism.

Default criteria for grouping (invoicing partner, company and used currency)
will be always applied, as if not respected, there will be business
inconsistencies, but you can add more fields to split the invoicing according
them.

Configuration
=============

For creating new grouping criteria:

#. Go to *Invoicing > Configuration > Management > Contracts Invoicing Grouping Criteria*.
#. Create or modify existing criteria, selecting fields belonging to "Contract" and "Contract Line" models for grouping according them.
#. Company, Invoicing address and currency will always be applied with the selected
   ones.

For setting a different grouping criteria for a specific customer:

#. Go to *Invoicing > Customers > Customers*.
#. Open the desired customer.
#. Go to *Invoicing* page.
#. Set on "Contracts Invoicing Grouping Criteria" the desired grouping
   criteria.

For setting a different default grouping criteria than the standard for the
whole company:

#. Go to *Invoicing > Configuration > Settings*.
#. Locate inside "Contract Order Invoicing" section, the field "Default
   Grouping Criteria".
#. Introduce there the grouping criteria to be applied by default. If empty,
   the general default of invoicing address + currency + company will be
   applied.

Usage
=====

This module will group contract invoices when several contracts are invoiced
together, by the cron method for instance.
