By default, portal users are allowed to see all the invoices in which a
member of their organization are followers. That could cause a leaking
of documents between members and departments and of the organization
that should stay private.

This module restricts that behavior so the portal users only see their
own documents.

A similar module named ``portal_sale_personal_data_only`` exists to do
the same for sale orders.

3. Log in with each portal user credential.
4. Only the invoices belonging to the logged in user's partner or his
   descendants should be accessible.
