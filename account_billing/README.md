Billing Process
===============

In some countries, there is a customary practice for
companies to collect money from their customers only once in a month.
For example, the customer has 3 payments due in a given month, the vendor or
billing company should group all the due AR Invoices in a document call
Billing Document and issue it with all the invoices consolidated to the
customer on the Billing Day. The customer will be paying based on the payable
amount shown in Billing Document in the following month.
