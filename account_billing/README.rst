In some countries, there is a customary practice for companies to collect money
from their customers only once in a month. For example, the customer has 3 payments due in
a given month, the vendor or billing company should group all the due AR Invoices in a document
call Billing Document and issue it with all the invoices consolidated to the customer on the Billing Day.
The customer will be paying based on the payable amount shown in Billing Document in the following month.

This module use a new document called "Billing" to group these invoices together.
