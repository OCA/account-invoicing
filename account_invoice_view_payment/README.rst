============================
Account Invoice View Payment
============================

This module allows users to access directly to the payment from an invoice
when registering a payment or afterwards.

The option to open the payment when it's being registered is useful
when the user needs to do a follow-up step on the payment, such as printing
the associated check.

Configuration
=============

Only users assigned to the group "Billing" can display the payments from
the invoice.

Usage
=====

Registering a payment
---------------------
#. Go to an open customer invoice or vendor bill and press 'Register Payment'.
#. Enter the payment details and press 'Validate & View Payment'.

After payment has been made
---------------------------
#. Go to an open customer invoice or vendor bill and press the link
   'View Payments' that appears next to the list of payments made for that
   invoice.
