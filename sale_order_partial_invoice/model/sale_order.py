"""
 * Adding qty_invoiced field on SO lines, computed based on invoice lines
   linked to it that has the same product. So this way, advance invoice will
   still work !

 * Adding qty_delivered field in SO Lines, computed from move lines linked to
   it. For services, the quantity delivered is a problem, the MRP will
   automatically run the procurement linked to this line and pass it to done. I
   suggest that in that case, delivered qty = invoiced_qty as the procurement
   is for the whole qty, it'll be a good alternative to follow what has been
   done and not.

 * Add in the "Order Line to invoice" view those fields

 * Change the behavior of the "invoiced" field of the SO line to be true when
   all is invoiced

 * Adapt the "_make_invoice" method in SO to deal with qty_invoiced

 * Adapt the sale_line_invoice.py wizard to deal with qty_invoiced, asking the
   user how much he want to invoice.

By having the delivered quantity, we can imagine in the future to provide an
invoicing "based on delivery" that will look at those values instead of looking
in picking.
