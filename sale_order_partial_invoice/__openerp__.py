Allow to partially invoice sale order lines
===========================================

With a sale order in 'manual' invoicing policy, when the user selects to
invoice some SO lines, a new wizard is display in which it is possible to
select how much of the different lines is to be invoiced. The amounts
invoiced and the amounts delivered are also displayed. When generating an
invoice for the whole sale order, the partial invoices are taken into
account and only the amounts not already invoiced are part of the new
invoice.
