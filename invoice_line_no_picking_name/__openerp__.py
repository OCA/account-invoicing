    'description': """
This module allows to not use the picking name on the invoice lines.

The picking name is added to invoice lines when you group pickings generating
one invoice from more than one picking.

To avoid this, the user has to belong to
group_not_use_picking_name_per_invoice_line.
This is possible by selecting the related option in the following menu:
