To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Accounting > Accounting > Journals > Extra Product Moves*.
#. Create a new Account Product Move record and give it a name.
#. Create Product Move Lines.
#. Update one or more product to link them to the Extra Product Move.
#. Create a new out invoice with lines referring to these products.
#. Post the out invoice.
#. If any of the products in invoice lines has an Extra Product Move record set-up,
   a new automatic journal entry will be added per line that refers to extra moves.

It is possible to apply an Account Product Move record only on invoices / moves that
meet certain criteria. To do this, filter your moves, and store the filter with sharing
set. Then select this filter on the Account Product Move record.
