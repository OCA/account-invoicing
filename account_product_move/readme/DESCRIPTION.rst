Create extra Journal entries and items when posting out-invoices, that depend on
the products in the invoice lines.

The extra journal entries created will remain linked to the original invoice, and
the status of the extra moves will depend on the status of the invoice.

Journal items can have a fixed amount debit or credit per unit of product
invoiced on a line, or the amount debit or credit can depend on the costprice
of the product.
