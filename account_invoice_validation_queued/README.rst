This module allows to enqueue in several jobs the account validation process
to be executed in paralell on background, which is normally done serially and
on foreground.

Each invoice creates a job for performing the validation, but you will only be
able to enqueue invoices for the same date.

Installation
============

This module depends on *queue_job* module that is hosted on
https://github.com/OCA/queue.

If you are migrating from version 13.0.1.0.0 to 13.0.2.0.0, you need
`openupgradelib` library.

Configuration
=============

#. Jobs are enqueued in the channel ``root.account_invoice_validation_queued``,
   so you must adjust your
   `Odoo configuration <https://github.com/OCA/queue/tree/13.0/queue_job#configuration>`_
   according this.
#. If you want to see queued jobs, you need "Job Queue / Job Queue Manager"
   permission in your user.
#. Configure your invoice/refund sequences as "Standard" instead of "No gap",
   or you'll have concurrent updates problems.

Usage
=====

#. Go to *Invoicing > Sales > Documents > Customer Invoices* or
   *Invoicing > Purchases > Documents > Vendor Bills*.
#. Mark at least one check on the left part of one draft invoice line in the
   list view.
#. Click on *Action > Confirm Draft Invoice*.
#. On the dialog popup that appears, click on "Enqueue Validation".
#. If any of the invoices is already enqueued, there will be a message saying
   so and avoiding to perform the process.
#. Once enqueued, and having the "Job Queue Manager" permission, you can go to
   the invoice, and see the tab "Validation Jobs". A list with all the jobs
   related to that invoice can be found there.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Allow to enqueue for validating invoices of different date.
* There's a chance that if you perform several enqueues of invoice validations
  from different dates, the order of the validated invoices, and thus, the
  number given for it, will result disordered.
