On the version 13.0 PR it has been discussed to rename the modules like this:

    * account_invoice_base_invoicing_mode -> partner_invoicing_mode
    * account_invoice_mode_monthly  -> partner_invoicing_mode_monthly
    * account_invoice_mode_at_shipping -> partner_invoicing_mode_at_shipping

It would be great to do it, during the version 15.0 migration.
