This module allows to use custom criteria for grouping purchases orders to be
invoiced.

Default criteria for grouping (partner, company and used currency)
will be always applied, as if not respected, there will be business
inconsistencies, but you can add more fields to split the invoicing according
them.

Configuration
=============

For creating new grouping criteria:

#. Go to *Invoicing > Configuration > Management > Purchase Invoicing Grouping Criteria*.
#. Create or modify existing criteria, selecting fields belonging to "Purchases
   Order" header model for grouping according them.
#. Partner and currency will always be applied with the selected ones.

For setting a different grouping criteria for a specific vendor:

#. Go to *Invoicing > Vendors > Vendors*.
#. Open the desired vendor.
#. Go to *Invoicing* page.
#. Set on "Purchases Invoicing Grouping Criteria" the desired grouping criteria.

For setting a different default grouping criteria than the standard for the
whole company:

#. Go to *Invoicing > Configuration> Settings*.
#. Locate inside "Purchases Order Invoicing" section, the field "Default
   Grouping Criteria".
#. Introduce there the grouping criteria to be applied by default. If empty,
   the general default of invoicing partner + currency + company will be
   applied.

Usage
=====

#. Go to *Purchase > Purchase orders*.
#. Select purchases orders whose invoicing you want to do.
#. Click on *Action > Create Vendor Bills*.
#. On that moment, the grouping criteria will be applied, and you will see
   different invoices if the criteria doesn't match for them.
