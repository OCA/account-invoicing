This module allows to enqueue in several jobs the email sending invoices
to be executed in parallel on background, which is normally done serially and
on foreground.

Each invoice creates a job for performing the email sending.

Installation
============

This module depends on *queue_job* module that is hosted on
https://github.com/OCA/queue.

Configuration
=============

#. Jobs are enqueued in the channel ``root.invoice_email_send_queue``,
   so you must adjust your
   `Odoo configuration <https://github.com/OCA/queue/tree/15.0/queue_job#configuration>`_
   according this.
#. If you want to see queued jobs, you need "Job Queue / Job Queue Manager"
   permission in your user.

Usage
=====

#. Go to *Invoicing > Sales > Documents > Customer Invoices* or
   *Invoicing > Purchases > Documents > Vendor Bills*.
#. Mark at least one check on the left some invoices line in the
   list view.
#. Click on *Action > Send & Print*.
#. On the dialog popup that appears, click on "Enqueue Send".
#. Once enqueued, and having the "Job Queue Manager" permission, you can go to
   the invoice, and see the tab "Email Sending Jobs". A list with all the jobs
   related to that invoice can be found there.
