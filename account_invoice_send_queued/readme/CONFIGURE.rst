#. Jobs are enqueued in the channel ``root.invoice_email_send_queue``,
   so you must adjust your
   `Odoo configuration <https://github.com/OCA/queue/tree/15.0/queue_job#configuration>`_
   according this.
#. If you want to see queued jobs, you need "Job Queue / Job Queue Manager"
   permission in your user.
