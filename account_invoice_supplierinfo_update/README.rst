This module allows to automatically update all products information in a vendor
bill for which the purchase information on the line is different from the
vendor information defined in the product form.

It creates a new vendor information line if there isn't any, or it updates the
first one in the list.

Usage
=====

This module adds a new button 'Check Supplier Info' in supplier
invoice form.

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/account-invoicing/14.0/account_invoice_supplierinfo_update/static/description/supplier_invoice_form.png

When the user clicks on it, they can see the changes that will apply to the
vendor information. Optionally, they can remove some temporary changes,
specially, if, for example, a vendor applied an exceptional price change.

* blue: Creates a full new supplier info line
* brown: Updates current settings, displaying price variation (%)

This module adds an extra boolean field 'Supplier Informations Checked' in the
'Other Info' tab inside the supplier invoice form.
This field indicates that the prices have been checked and
supplierinfo updated (or eventually that the changes have been ignored).

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* This module does not manage correctly the difference if invoice line taxes
  are not the same as products taxes. (If one is marked as tax included in the
  price and the other is marked as tax excluded in the price.)

* Refactor this module to share algorithm with the similar module
  `purchase_order_supplierinfo_update`
