Account Payment Confirm
===================

This module allows to confirm a selection of payments at the same time.
In the Payment list view, you can check several lines, then click the Action
button, and you'll find the Confirm Payments options.
If one of the payments you selected is not confirmable, you'll get a detailed
message that will help you to tell which one failed.
