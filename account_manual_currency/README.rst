This module allows users to update the currency manually for invoices that are still in the draft stage.
It offers flexibility to companies when calculating currency rates for invoicing.

For example, if a company makes a deal with a vendor but the actual purchase happens on a different day,
this module lets them choose whether to use the currency rate from the accounting date
or a special rate agreed upon during the deal.
This ensures accurate currency rate calculations for invoices,
even when the purchase date and deal date differ.

Usage
=====

To use this module, the company must have access rights for multiple currencies.

Follow these steps to use manual currency:

#. Go to Invoicing > Create new invoice/bills.
#. If you need to change the currency to one other than the company's default currency, you will see an option for 'Manual Currency'.
#. Check the 'Manual Currency' box to enable manual currency entry.
#. Specify the desired currency rate for the selected currency.
