This module allows users to update the currency manually for invoices that are still in the draft stage.
It offers flexibility to companies when calculating currency rates for invoicing.

For example, if a company makes a deal with a vendor but the actual purchase happens on a different day,
this module lets them choose whether to use the currency rate from the accounting date
or a special rate agreed upon during the deal.
This ensures accurate currency rate calculations for invoices,
even when the purchase date and deal date differ.
