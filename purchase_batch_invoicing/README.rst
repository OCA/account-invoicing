Purchase Batch Invoicing
========================

This module extends the functionality of purchases to support batch invoicing
purchase orders and to allow you to choose if you want them grouped by purchase
order or by vendor.

Configuration
=============

An automated task is included to invoice all pending purchase orders every
week, but it is disabled by default. To enable it:

#. Have *Administration / Settings* permissions.
#. Go to *[Your user menu] > About > Activate the developer mode*.
#. Go to *Settings > Technical > Automation > Scheduled Actions > Invoice all
   pending purchase orders > Edit*.
#. Enable it by clicking on *Active* and set the date accordingly.
#. Save.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Have *Purchase / User* permissions.
#. Go to *Purchases > Purchase > Purchase Orders > Create* and fill the form.
#. Press *Confirm*.
#. Press *Receive Products*.
#. Press *Validate > Apply*.
#. Repeat above steps a couple of times.
#. Go back to *Purchase Orders*, select those you just created and press
   *Action > Batch Invoice*. Alternatively, you can use the *Create Invoice*
   button in the purchase order form.
#. You get a wizard with a list of ready-to-invoice purchase orders. Choose the
   *Grouping* method.
