Usage
=====

Create a new invoice and add discounts in any of the three discount fields
given. They go in order of precedence so discount 2 will be calculated over
discount 1 and discount 3 over the result of discount 2. For example, let's
divide by two on every discount:

Unit price: 600.00 ->

  - Disc. 1 = 50% -> Amount = 300.00
  - Disc. 2 = 50% -> Amount = 150.00
  - Disc. 3 = 50% -> Amount = 75.00

You can also use negative values to charge instead of discount:

Unit price: 600.00 ->

  - Disc. 1 = 50% -> Amount = 300.00
  - Disc. 2 = -5% -> Amount = 315.00
