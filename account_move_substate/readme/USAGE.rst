#. Go to ** Settings > Technical > Database Structure ** and Add  "Base substate".
    If necessary you can add "target State values" (ex define a substate for "cancel"
    state).
    Substate sequence is very important.
#. Create a journal entry and check if the substate are displayed on the header of
    form view. Check if you can't set substate defined for journal entry if state is a draft.
