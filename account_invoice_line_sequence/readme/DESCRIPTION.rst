Provides a new sequence field on invoice lines which helps to manage the order of the invoice lines.

The sequence number always starts at 1 and rises incrementally: 1, 2, 3, ... To keep it that way, all sequence numbers are recalculated when the order of invoice lines is changed. The line number is printed on the invoice report.
