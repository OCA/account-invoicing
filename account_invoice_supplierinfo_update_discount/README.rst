This module is a glue module installed if the following module are installed:

* ``purchase_discount`` (purchase-workflow repository)

It allows to update discount on supplierinfo, if the invoice line has a
different discount value.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Odoo ``account`` module displays discounts on invoice lines only if ``sale``
module is installed, that is bad design. To avoid useless dependencies, this
module does not depend on sale module, and so, displays allways discount
features, even if the user doesn't belong to the group 
``sale.group_discount_per_so_line``.
