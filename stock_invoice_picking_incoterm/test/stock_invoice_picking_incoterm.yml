  In order to test the stock_invoice_picking_incoterm module.
  First I create an outgoing picking order
-
  !record {model: stock.picking, id: stock_picking_out0}:
    partner_id: base.res_partner_address_22
    invoice_state: 2binvoiced
    move_lines:
      - company_id: base.main_company
        location_id: stock.stock_location_stock
        product_id: product.product_product_3
        product_qty: 3.0
        product_uom: product.product_uom_unit
        location_dest_id: stock.stock_location_customers
    move_type: direct
    type: out
-
  I modify the outgoing picking order and set the incoterm.
-
  !record {model: stock.picking, id: stock_picking_out0}:
    incoterm: stock.incoterm_EXW
-
  I process the delivery
-
  !python {model: stock.transfer_details}: |
    partial_id = self.create(cr, uid, {}, context={'active_model':'stock.picking',
                                                   'active_ids':[ref('stock_picking_out0')]})
    self.do_detailed_transfer(cr, uid, [partial_id])

-
  As the invoice state of the picking order is to be invoiced. I create invoice for my outgoing picking order.
-
  !python {model: stock.invoice.onshipping}: |
    wiz_id = self.create(cr, uid, {'invoice_date': '2010-08-04', 'journal_id': ref('account.sales_journal')},
      {'active_ids': [ref("stock_picking_out0")], "active_model": "stock.picking"})
    self.create_invoice(cr, uid, [wiz_id], {"lang": "en_US",
      "search_default_available": 1, "tz": False, "active_model": "stock.picking",
      "contact_display": "partner", "active_ids": [ref("stock_picking_out0")], "active_id": ref("stock_picking_out0")})
-
  I check that the invoice incoterm has equal to stock incoterm.
-
  !python {model: stock.picking}: |
    picking = self.browse(cr, uid, ref('stock_picking_out0'))
    assert picking.invoice_id.incoterm == picking.incoterm, 'The incoterm values are different'
