Stock Invoice Picking Incoterm
==============================

This module adds the field incoterm to invoice and picking. In this way the
user can specify the incoterm directly on these documents, with no need to
refer to the incoterm of the order (which could even be missing).
The module extends 'stock_invoice_picking' so that the invoices created
from pickings will have the same incoterm set in the picking.
