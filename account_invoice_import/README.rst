Account Invoice Import
======================

This module has been started by lazy accounting users who hate enter they supplier invoices manually in Odoo. As ERP consultants, we have several supplier invoices to enter regularly in the system from the same suppliers: phone bill, Internet access, train tickets, etc. Most of these invoices are available as PDF. We dream that we would be able to automatically extract from the PDF the required information to enter the invoice as supplier invoice in Odoo. To know the full story behind the development of this module, read this `blog post <http://www.akretion.com/blog/akretions-christmas-present-for-the-odoo-community>`_.

In the future, we believe we will have structured information embedded inside the metadata of PDF invoices. There are 2 main standards for electronic invoicing:

* `CII <http://tfig.unece.org/contents/cross-industry-invoice-cii.htm>`_ (Cross-Industry Invoice) developped by `UN/CEFACT <http://www.unece.org/cefact>`_ (United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business),
* `UBL <http://ubl.xml.org/>`_ (Universal Business Language) developped by `OASIS <https://www.oasis-open.org/>`_ (Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards).

For example, there is already a standard in Germany called `ZUGFeRD <http://www.pdflib.com/knowledge-base/pdfa/zugferd-invoices/>`_ which is based on CII.

Here is how the module works:

* the user starts a wizard and uploads the PDF or XML invoice,
* if the PDF file has an embedded XML file in ZUGFeRD/CII format, Odoo will read this file,
* otherwise, Odoo will use the *invoice2data* Python library to try to interpret the text of the PDF,
* if there is already some draft supplier invoice for this supplier, Odoo will propose to select one to update or create a new draft invoice,
* otherwise, Odoo will directly create a new draft supplier invoice and attach the PDF to it.

This module also works with supplier refunds.

Installation
============

This module requires the Python library *invoice2data* available on `Github <https://github.com/manuelRiel/invoice2data>`_.

To install the right version of the library, run:

.. code::

  sudo pip install git+https://github.com/manuelRiel/invoice2data.git

This librairy requires the *pdftotext* utility, which is available on most Linux distributions in the package *poppler-utils*. To install it on a Debian or Ubuntu system, run:

.. code::

  sudo apt-get install poppler-utils

For some suppliers, it may be important to have a recent version of poppler-utils, to have a better support for accents. For example, the invoices of Free mobile work fine with poppler-utils version 0.33.0, but don't work with poppler-utils version 0.24.5 when the month name has accents (DÃ©cembre, which is December in French).

French users should also install the module *l10n_fr_invoice_pdf_import* available in the `French localization <https://github.com/OCA/l10n-france/>`_.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, go to the menu *Accounting > Configuration > Miscellaneous > Import Supplier Invoices* and create the import configuration entries for some suppliers.

Then, go to the form view of the suppliers and make sure that:

* *is a Company ?* is True
* *Supplier* is True
* the *TIN* (i.e. VAT number) is set (the VAT number is used by default when searching the supplier in the Odoo partner database)
* in the *Accounting* tab, select the *Invoice Import Configuration*.

For the PDF invoice of your supplier that don't have an embedded XML file, you will have to update the `template file <https://github.com/manuelRiel/invoice2data/blob/master/invoice2data/templates.py>`_ of the invoice2data Python library. It is quite easy to do ; if you are familiar with `regexp <https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html>`_, it should not take more than 10 minutes for each supplier.

Here are some hints to help you add a template for your supplier:

* Take Free SAS (keyword = FR 604 219 388 61) as an example. You will find a sample PDF invoice for this supplier under invoice2data/test/pdfs/2015-07-02-invoice_free_fiber.pdf

* Try to run the invoice2data library manually on the sample invoice of Free:

.. code::

  % python -m invoice2data.main invoice2data/test/pdfs/2015-07-02-invoice_free_fiber.pdf

On the output, you will get first the text of the PDF, then some debug info on the parsing of the invoice and the regexps, and, on the last line, you will have the dict that contain the result of the parsing.

* if the VAT number of the supplier is present in the text of the PDF invoice, I think it's a good idea to use it as the keyword

* the 'data' dict should contain the following keys:

  * 'vat' with the VAT number of the supplier (if the VAT number of the supplier is not in the text of PDF file, add a 'partner_name' key, or, if the supplier is French and the module *l10n_fr_invoice_pdf_import* is installed, add a 'siren' key)
  * 'amount_untaxed' and 'amount' ('amount' is the total amount with taxes). These 2 keys are required.
  * 'date': the date of the invoice
  * 'invoice_number'
  * 'date_due', if this information is available in the text of the PDF file.

Usage
=====

To use this module, go to the menu *Accounting > Suppliers > Import Invoices* and upload a PDF invoice of your supplier.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Remove dependency on *base_iban* and develop a separate glue module between this module and *base_iban*

* Enhance the update of an existing invoice by analysing the lines (lines are only available when the invoice has an embedded XML file)

* Add a mail gateway to be able to forward the emails that we receive with PDF invoices to a dedicated address ; the gateway would detach the PDF invoice from the email and create the draft supplier invoice in Odoo.
