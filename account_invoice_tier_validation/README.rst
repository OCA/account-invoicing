#. Create as many tiers as you want for Invoice model.

Usage
=====

#. Create a Invoice triggering at least one "Tier Definition".
#. Click on *Request Validation* button.
#. Under the tab *Reviews* have a look to pending reviews and their statuses.
#. Once all reviews are validated click on *Validate*.

Additional features:

* You can filter the Invoices requesting your review through the filter *Needs my
