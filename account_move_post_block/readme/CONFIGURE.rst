* Go to ‘Invoicing / Configuration / Invoicing / Purchase Approval Block Reasons’ and
  create the blocking reasons as needed, providing a name and a description. A field
  ‘Active’ allows you to deactivate the reason if you do not plan to use it any more.
* Assign the security group 'Release Journal Entry with post block' to users
  that should be able to release the block. Users in group 'Invoicing / Billing Administrator' are
  by default assigned to this group.
