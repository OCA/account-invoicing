This module allows you to block the post of a journal entry when a Post
Block Reason has been provided. The moves will be waiting for post by a Manager.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

* Go to ‘Invoicing / Configuration / Invoicing / Purchase Approval Block Reasons’ and
  create the blocking reasons as needed, providing a name and a description. A field
  ‘Active’ allows you to deactivate the reason if you do not plan to use it any more.
* Assign the security group 'Release Journal Entry with post block' to users
  that should be able to release the block. Users in group 'Invoicing / Billing Administrator' are
  by default assigned to this group.

Usage
=====

Set the Journal Entry Post Block
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Go to ‘Invoicing’ and go to create an Invoice or a Bill.
#. Indicate the post block reason (found in the 'Other Info' tab).

Search existing Journal Entries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a filter ‘Blocked’ to search for moves that are blocked for post.
It is also possible to search journal entries with a specific block reason.

Confirm the Journal Entry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Press the button ‘Post’. If there's a post block, you will need to request
   a Billing Manager release the post block in order to approve it.

Release the entry post block
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While the Journal Entry is in draft, members of security group
‘Release Journal Entry with post block’ can see a button ‘Release Post Block’
and click on it. From this point and on, anyone seeing that Journal Entry will
be able to validate it.

Notifications to followers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Followers of the Journal entry receive notifications when a post block has been
set or released.
