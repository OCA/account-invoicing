This module extends the functionality of purchase orders to better manage
supplier returns and refunds.

In the purchase order you are able to display, for each line:

* Billed Quantity and Refunded Quantity, as separate fields.

* Received Quantity and Returned Refundable Quantity, as separate fields.

You have the option to create a vendor bill or a refund. In the bill or refund
the correct quantity will be proposed, based on those fields.
